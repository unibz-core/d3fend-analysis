# An Ontological Analysis and Redesign of the D3FEND Cybersecurity Model

[D3FEND](https://d3fend.mitre.org/) is an OWL knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures proposed by a group at the [MITRE Corporation](https://www.mitre.org/news-insights/impact-story/mitres-d3fend-connects-cyber-community-counter-threats). Based on the [_Reference Ontology for Security Enginnering_ (ROSE)](https://purl.org/security-ontology), we provide an ontological analysis and redesign of the D3FEND cybersecurity model. This repository includes all files related to this study.

## Project Structure

* [/original-d3fend](original-d3fend) contains the original versions of D3FEND that are the objects of our study.
* [/d3fend-issues](d3fend-issues) contains files that show some of the D3FEND's ontological issues discovered by our analysis.
* [/ontouml-d3fend](/ontouml-d3fend) should, in the future, contain files related to the redesigned conceptual model of D3FEND based on ROSE, represented in OntoUML language.
* [/new-owl-d3fend](/new-owl-d3fend) should, in the future, contain files related to the [gUFO-based](https://nemo-ufes.github.io/gufo/) implementation of the redesigned conceptual model of D3FEND.
